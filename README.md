# Neural Hawkes Pytorch

This repository is a simple pytorch implementation of the paper Hongyuan Mei, Jason Eisner [The Neural Hawkes Process: A Neurally Self-Modulating Multivariate Point Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09328)
<br />
This repository is under development now. The model can only be trained, and be tested on log likelihood on seqs, time, and type in the current version. More functions are comming soon.
<br />

In order to train the model, please use 
<pre>!python train.py --help</pre> for more information

In order to test the model, please type 
<pre>!python test.py --help</pre> for more information.
